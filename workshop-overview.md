# ASSURE 2022 Electronics Workshop
Over the next couple of hours we'll explore:
- How to safely interact with electronics at the lab
- How to measure instanteous voltages with multimeter
- How to measure voltage waveforms with oscilloscopes
- How to program a microcontroller (RP24040) in CircuitPython
- How to get data from sensors attached to the microcontroller
- How to use that data to make plots and draw conclusions
- How to run your own balloon experiment! (Measuring movement, pressure, temperature, and humidity as you slowly let a balloon up into the air and back down)

## Schedule

### 2:00pm - 2:10pm
- Introduction of workshop
- Photos of Antartica balloon experiments
- Photos of test of the culminating balloon at the end of workshop

### 2:10pm - 2:50pm
- Sensitive electronics around the lab
- Electro-static discharge events 
- Wrist straps and ESD mats
- Digital Voltmeters, probe 3.3V and GND, probe Bat and GND
- Oscilloscope, probe digital outputs of RP2040 set to various square waves

### 3pm - 4:10pm: 
- Introduction to microcontrollers, specifically RP2040
- CircuitPython via the Mu editor, differences from Python (Loops!)
- Blink LED from scratch
- Description of flash memory on RP2040
- Accelerometer sensor code walkthrough
- Try out Accelerometer sensor and pull data for quick analysis
- Open jupyter(?) and use .csv from RP2040 to make plots of acceleration vs time
- Air sensor code walkthrough
- Try out Air sensor and print out boring data

4:20pm - 5pm:
- Assemble balloon payloads, inflate balloons, mark string
- Take balloons outside and test! Get a few repeats, someone marking approximately when events occur
- Bring balloons back inside for making basic graphs of all data over time (could be continued next day!)

## Prep for Scott:

- Setup all RP2040s with code that changes outputs to various square waves
